# Dogs
DogSearching
It was one of my first projects that I created at the beginning on my journey. As I am an animal lover the purpose was to help finding home for dogs whe don't have any.There is a carousel on the main page,  I have  created from scratch , a a quick search engine in order to filter the dogs database (gender, age, location, breed),and this navigate us over to searching page. There news section that dinamically render all the news about the dogs. I have use a lot of stuff here,  it was my first try using js in a website .
